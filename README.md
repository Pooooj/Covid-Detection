# Covid-Detection
A renowned chain of hospitals is facing a problem of increased overload on resources (human as well as medical) due to a rise in the number of COVID cases. They want your help to build an AI solution that will help them predict the likelihood of a patient being infected by COVID by analyzing a chest X-ray scan of the patient to segregate the patients who are less likely to have COVID and prioritize critical cases.

**Solution Approach**

The AI solution approach involves the scanning of chest X-rays of patients to detect patterns commonly found in COVID-infected people. Conducting a chest X-ray scan and obtaining the resultant scan image for a patient requires approx. 15 minutes. The chest X-rays can be passed to our AI solution and based on the likelihood of COVID.

This methodology can provide the following advantages to hospital:

Segregating cases of mild symptoms with lower chances of COVID from the critical cases
Reduced TAT for test results, leading to quicker diagnosis
Early detection of signs of COVID infection, even before symptoms become severe
Resource-efficiency as X-ray machines are commonly available in medical facilities
Isolation of patients to contain the further spread of COVID to unaffected people
The X-ray based detection can be used in conjunction with RT-PCR testing to increase the accuracy of diagnosis.
